<h1>HIIT Trainer</h1><br></br>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>High-intensity interval training (HIIT), is a form of interval training, a cardiovascular exercise strategy alternating short periods of intense anaerobic exercise with less intense recovery periods, until too exhausted to continue. Though there is no universal HIIT session duration, these intense workouts typically last under 30 minutes, with times varying based on a participant's current fitness level. The duration of HIIT also depends on the intensity of the session.</p>
<p>This apps purpose is to have a timer to tell the user when they should be in a high intensity state and when to be in a low intensity state.  The user is able to change the full duration of the cardio workout and set the length of high intensity intervals.</p>
